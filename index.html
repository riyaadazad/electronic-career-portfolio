                                <blockquote cite="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/software-developers.htm">Software developers are the creative minds behind computer programs. Some develop the applications that allow people to do specific tasks on a computer or another device. Others develop the underlying systems that run the devices or that control networks. Many software developers work for firms that deal in computer systems design and related services, manufacturing, or for software publishers. Software developers are in charge of the entire development process for a software program. They may begin by asking how the customer plans to use the software. They must identify the core functionality that users need from software programs. Software developers must also determine user requirements that are unrelated to the functions of the software, such as the level of security and performance needs. They design the program and then give instructions to programmers, who write computer code and test it. If the program does not work as expected or if testers find it too difficult to use, software developers go back to the design process to fix the problems or improve the program. After the program is released to the customer, a developer may perform upgrades and maintenance. Developers usually work closely with computer programmers. However, in some companies, developers write code themselves instead of giving instructions to programmers. Developers who supervise a software project from the planning stages through implementation sometimes are called information technology (IT) project managers. These workers monitor the project’s progress to ensure that it meets deadlines, standards, and cost targets. </blockquote>

                                <blockquote cite="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/software-developers.htm#tab-2">Applications software developers design computer applications, such as word processors and games, for consumers. They may create custom software for a specific customer or commercial software to be sold to the general public. Some applications software developers create complex databases for organizations. They also create programs that people use over the Internet and within a company’s intranet.</blockquote>

                                <blockquote cite="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/software-developers.htm#tab-3">In general, software development is a collaborative process, and developers work on teams with others who also contribute to designing, developing, and programming successful software. However, some developers work at home. Most software developers work full time, and additional work hours are common.</blockquote>

                                <h3>Required Education</h3>
								<blockquote cite="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/software-developers.htm#tab-4">Software developers usually have a bachelor’s degree, typically in computer science, software engineering, or a related field. Computer science degree programs are the most common, because they tend to cover a broad range of topics. Students should focus on classes related to building software to better prepare themselves for work in the occupation. Many students gain experience in software development by completing an internship at a software company while in college. For some positions, employers may prefer that applicants have a master’s degree. Although writing code is not their first priority, developers must have a strong background in computer programming. They usually gain this experience in school. Throughout their career, developers must keep up to date on new tools and computer languages. Software developers also need skills related to the industry in which they work. Developers working in a bank, for example, should have knowledge of finance so that they can understand a bank’s computing needs. Software developers can advance to become information technology (IT) project managers, also called computer and information systems managers, a position in which they oversee the software development process.</blockquote>

                                <h3>Job Outlook</h3>
                               <blockquote cite="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/software-developers.htm#tab-5">The median annual wage for software developers, applications was $103,620 in May 2018. The median wage is the wage at which half the workers in an occupation earned more than that amount and half earned less. The lowest 10 percent earned less than $61,660, and the highest 10 percent earned more than $161,290. The median annual wage for software developers, systems software was $110,000 in May 2018. The lowest 10 percent earned less than $66,740, and the highest 10 percent earned more than $166,960.</blockquote>

                                <blockquote cite="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/software-developers.htm#tab-6">Employment of software developers is projected to grow 24 percent from 2016 to 2026, much faster than the average for all occupations. Employment of applications developers is projected to grow 31 percent, and employment of systems developers is projected to grow 11 percent. The main reason for the growth in both applications developers and systems developers is a large increase in the demand for computer software. The need for new applications on smart phones and tablets will help increase the demand for applications software developers. The health and medical insurance and reinsurance carriers industry will need innovative software to manage new healthcare policy enrollments and administer existing policies digitally. As the number of people who use this digital platform increases over time, demand for software developers will grow. Systems developers are likely to see new opportunities because of an increase in the number of products that use software. For example, more computer systems are being built into consumer electronics and other products, such as cell phones and appliances. Concerns over threats to computer security could result in more investment in security software to protect computer networks and electronic infrastructure. In addition, an increase in software offered over the Internet should lower costs and allow more customization for businesses, also increasing demand for software developers. Job prospects will be best for applicants with knowledge of the most up-to-date programming tools and for those who are proficient in one or more programming languages.</blockquote>

                                <h3>HTML-Tricks</h3>
                                <span class="image main"><img src="https://riyaadazad.github.io/images/screenshot-html-tricks.png" alt="Screenshot of my HTML tricks site" /></span>
								<p>In my Design, Multimedia, and Web Technologies class that I took during my sophomore year, I learned many design theories, multimedia applications, and of course, web technologies. We were tasked with creating a blog on <a href="https://wordpress.org/" target="_blank">Wordpress</a>, and I disliked Wordpress so much that my instructor allowed my to create my blog using Jekyll (learn more about Jekyll <a href="https://jekyllrb.com" target="_blank">here</a>), a simpler and better way to host a website.</p>

                                <h3>riyaadazad.github.io</h3>
                                <span class="image main"><img src="https://riyaadazad.github.io/images/screenshot-riyaadazad-github-io.png" alt="Screenshot of my current personal website" /></span>
								<p>This <a href="https://riyaadazad.github.io/" target="_blank">website</a> is testimony to my extensive knowledge of front-end website development technologies. I have dedicated endless hours and brainpower to making it best that it can be. Feel free to explore—you might just be surprised at what you find. I would be remiss to not give credit to <a href="https://html5up.net/"" target="_blank">HTML5 UP</a>, which is responsible for the amazing design of this web site. This website is also powered by the lightweight static site generator, Jekyll, which was integrated in this site by <a href="https://soundgrail.com/" target="_blank">SoundGrail</a>. And, of course, the content in all of my sites is 100% from me.</p>

                                <h3>old-riyaadazad.github.io</h3>
                                <span class="image main"><img src="https://riyaadazad.github.io/images/screenshot-old-riyaadazad-github-io.png" alt="Screenshot of an older version of my personal website" /></span>
								<p>Before I created <a href="https://riyaadazad.github.io/" target="_blank">my current site</a>, I had another site with an outdated design. Although I had coded the old website 100% by myself, and I take pride in my artistic skill, I realize that I am more of a developer than a designer. (I prefer implementing beautiful designs and user interfaces.) Because of this, I did not feel uncomfortable using the brilliant work of another designer, <a href="https://html5up.net/" target="_blank">HTML5 UP</a>, in my new and improved web site. The old site is still visible <a href="https://riyaadazad.github.io/old-riyaadazad.github.io/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
